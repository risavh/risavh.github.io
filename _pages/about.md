I'm a Senior Data Scientist at [Jetstar Airways](https://www.jetstar.com/au/en/about-us?pid=mainfooter:about-us), an Australian low-cost airline, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Qantas. I help businesses to make data-driven decisions by transforming data into meaningful stories and actionable insights. 

Before joining Jetstar, I was working for [GE Aviation](https://www.geaviation.com/) as Senior Data Scientist, building models for Predictive maintenance (Engine Failure) & Inventory Management. 

I led and implemented multiple analytics projects for over 10 years. I love to solve challenging problems involving Machine Learning, Deep Learning.

More broadly, Iâ€™m interested in machine learning to augment human capabilities, especially for social good, building applications involving deep learning & reinforcement learning. It's an exciting time to be a part of such an amazing field.
